                                in the European Union, the tax system is attractive to foreign investors. Neither
                                succession taxes nor gains from the disposal of securities are subject to tax.</p>

                                Cyprus should only take about 1-3 months. Of course, each situation is different and
                                this timeframe may vary from one individual to another. Our relocation services aim to
                                simplify this process by providing guidance and assistance from start to finish. </p>
