                        an ideal place to live looks like. While some people prefer to live by the beach, others prefer
                        the mountains. You may long to live in a quiet little village, while others enjoy the bustling
                        life of the city. So, why do thousands of families choose Cyprus as their ultimate destination?

                                in the European Union, the tax system is attractive to foreign investors. Neither
                                succession taxes nor gains from the disposal of securities are subject to tax.</p>

                                Cyprus should only take about 1-3 months. Of course, each situation is different and
                                this timeframe may vary from one individual to another. Our relocation services aim to
                                simplify this process by providing guidance and assistance from start to finish. </p>
